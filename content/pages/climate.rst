1. Welcome (5’)
---------------
- Co-chairs reiterate the commiteee goals & the plan for this meeting.
- Collect other business for item (5).


2. Report-out from the 2022 TRB AM (10’)
----------------------------------------

- Subcommittee & parent committee members who attended the in-person TRB Annual Meeting in January summarize climate change related research and content: the most interesting posters, presentations, and discussions.
- Other suggestions shared via Twitter with @TRBClimate.

3. Panel: Assessing transport and climate change: from IPCC AR6 to US NCA5 (45’ to 60’)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We take advantage of the facts that:

- The IPCC’s `Sixth Assessment Report (AR6) Working Group III (WGIII, on mitigation) <https://www.ipcc.ch/report/sixth-assessment-report-working-group-3/>`_ contribution is completed and due to be released imminently, including Chapter 10, on Transport.
- The `U.S. Fifth National Climate Assessment (NCA5) <https://www.globalchange.gov/nca5>`_ is about to get underway in 2022.

While there are important differences, these two assessment exercises are also similar in many respects.
Our panel convenes participants in both, drawn from AMS30(2) and parent committee memberships, to address the practical challenges of performing salient, credible, and legitimate assessments that support strong responses to the challenge of climate change:

- What are the chief obstacles/challenges in preparing these assessments? Scientific/knowledge, logistical?
- Where are key gaps in the literature?
- What difficulties in translating from current scientific topics to policy-relevant language in a report?
- How can researchers make their work easily available to/usable by assessment authors, ensuring it can be cited/used?
- What’s your #1 (or #2, or #3) wish for support or resources to do a better assessment?


Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- What are the criteria for a good assessment, in general?
