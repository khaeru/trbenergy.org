Call for papers: Transportation Energy Transitions
**************************************************

:tags: cfp, 2022
:status: draft

The TRB Transportation Energy Committee (AMS30) seeks papers on a broad range of topics related to Transportation Energy Transitions.
Of particular interest are papers that report on transportation energy transitions in the context of climate mitigation goals, including the timing, pace, and pathways for changes in fuels and fleets.
While a large share of submissions are typically focused on light-duty vehicle fleet and energy use, the committee also encourages authors to submit new papers on the energy use and efficiency in medium-duty, heavy-duty, rail, aviation, and marine modes.
Within the scope of this call for papers are studies examining the implications for upstream energy markets—petroleum, electric power, natural gas, renewable fuels—in the context of the broader energy system.
Authors are encouraged to consider a broad range of social—including economic and equity—and environmental aspects of changing transport energy systems,  including both impacts of energy production and use on these phenomena, and vice versa.

In addition to consideration for review and publication in TRR, the committee will organize presentation and podium sessions at the 2022 Annual Meeting (January 9–13, 2022).
High quality papers relevant to subcommittee work can also be highlighted during committee and subcommittee meetings.
Where appropriate, this committee will also work with other committees to identify papers of common interest.

Eligible papers can address a broad range of topics related to transportation energy and energy transitions.
These include, but are not limited to, the following topic areas:

1. Transportation energy and climate transitions, for instance as related to decarbonization or carbon neutrality policies and targets.
2. Changes in global, inter- and trans-national transportation energy systems, beyond the United States.
3. Social and behavioral aspects of choices regarding transportation fuels, efficiency, and vehicles, as well as energy impacts of reduced and avoided transportation activity.
4. Consumer preferences and trends in a changing new and used technology market, including affordability and equity dimensions, and policy related thereto.
5. Advances in fuel economy technologies and performance in light and heavy-duty vehicles fleets, including test cycles, real-world performance, and impacts of driver behavior and eco-driving.
6. Energy impacts of connected and automated vehicles (CAVs).
7. Energy impacts of changes in transportation activity or demand, mode choice, and ‘new’ mobility options including shared vehicles (e.g., cars, e-scooters, bikes), ride-sharing, and ride-hailing
8. Energy use and implications of emerging technologies for urban delivery.
9. Energy security and resilience impacts of changing vehicle fleets and energy infrastructure.
